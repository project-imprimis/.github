Welcome to the Imprimis project!

If you would like to contribute to Imprimis, that's great!
We welcome and greatly value contributions from anybody that submits useful
code or assets and follows the guidelines of the project.

The majority of the work at present is located at the `imprimis` repository,
as well as the documentation and installation instructions for the main
codebase. It is recommended that you look through the documentation currently
available, and to contact one of the developers if you need particular
documentation written to be able to understand a particular section
of the codebase. The easiest way to contact a developer is either by creating
an issue requesting particular documentation or by joining the project's
Discord server, linked at the bottom of this text.

To contribute to the project, the recommended way to do so is to create a
*fork* of the project, which can be done by anyone with a GitHub account,
using the button at the top right corner of the repository's header bar.
Contributions can then be made to your own copy of the codebase, whereupon
you may open a pull request to merge the contribution into the Imprimis
master codebase. Be aware that to merge contributions with the Imprimis
project, contributions must waive some of their copyrights by placing
contributions under the same level of free access as the rest of the code
base.

To have a successful pull request, it is essential that the contribution
that you propose has been first created as an issue on the relevant
repository: unsolicited pull requests are problematic in that here at the
project we want to make sure that contributors do not waste time without
knowing if their work is on-topic.

Once an issue has been created and then accepted into the current master
project at https://github.com/orgs/project-imprimis/projects/, it is
considered available to have a resolution submitted as a pull request.
Issues created by members of the project itself are also located on this
master project, and this board tracks the status of issues currently
in flight in the project. The project board located at the aformentioned
link is the master project plan and there is no behind-the-scenes planning
occuring at this project.

Issues on the master project which have not been assigned to a particular
person are open, and outside contributors are welcome to create solutions
for these open issues. In fact, these issues are likely the best way to
get introduced to working with the Imprimis project, as many of them are
reasonably straightforward. If you would like to resolve a particular issue,
but would like more information on how to approach doing so, feel free to
comment on the issue asking for help.

For help working with the game, or to get to know the Imprimis development
community, there is a public Discord server located at https://discord.gg/WVFjtzA .
This is the location that members of the Imprimis community are most likely
to be available on short notice, but as the size of the community is quite
small at present, quick response may not always be possible.

Please do reach out to a developer if something here or elsewhere is unclear
and we will try to resolve it as quickly as practible.

Thanks for contributing!
