It is recommended that you title the issue in the following way: 
If you wanted documentation on *foo*, *bar*, and *baz*, name your issue as
the following:

*Document Foo, Bar, Baz*

Leave explainations in the body text of the issue. While a documentation request
should be used as a way to ask a question, it is prefered that documentation
requests are issued as a request and not a question. Adding to the project's
documentation is a key part of the work done on the project and is part of the
project's permanent body of work.

Note that documentation requests are treated as recommendations for topics to
document and may not be turned around particularly quickly or at all.

**-- Fill out this part of the filler text --**

**Describe what needs documenting**
A clear and concise description of what part of the engine needs documentation.

**Describe the utility of documenting**
If possible, describe what particular utility that documenting this engine has
for you. This helps with understanding what parts in particular are confusing
or need further clarification. Without this information, documentation may end
up being correct but vague or not particularly helpful for your applications.
